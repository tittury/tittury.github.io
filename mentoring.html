    <h2>Mentoring</h2>
    <p>
      Mentoring is a collaborative relationship whose central goal is to transfer knowledge, experiences, and
      perspectives from the mentor to the mentee, or actor. As a method, mentoring is simple and flexible: it is based
      on the interaction between the actor and the mentor. Mentoring has been found to, for example, increase job
      satisfaction, predict higher salaries and faster career advancement, facilitate job searching and interview
      situations, and provide the mentee with more realistic expectations regarding work life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The content of the mentoring is determined by the actor's interests, questions, and goals. For the mentoring to be
      successful, it is important for the actor to set relevant goals and strive to achieve them. Discussions are based
      on trust, commitment, and openness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal of TiTTu's mentoring program, being organized for the first time, is to harness the experience and
      expertise of the alumni network for the benefit of younger students, for example, in envisioning the future,
      career planning, and job searching. The mentoring program can also be conducted in English if suitable
      English-speaking mentors are available.
    </p>

    <h2>Benefits of Mentoring</h2>
    <div>
      <h3>For the mentee</h3>
      <p>
        TiTTu's mentoring program offers students the opportunity to find direction in working life, explore different
        career options, and gain new perspectives and practical tips on the challenges and questions they encounter.
        Through the mentoring program, you get the chance to meet and discuss with an IT professional at length about
        topics that interest and concern you. Based on these discussions, it is easy to continue development and find
        confidence and motivation for studies and working life.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>For the mentor</h3>
      <p>
        Mentoring offers the mentor a unique opportunity to develop their own leadership and communication skills. By
        sharing their experiences and perspectives, the mentor can help a younger student grow professionally and
        personally. At the same time, the mentor gains new perspectives on the development of their own field and
        networks with other professionals in the field. Mentoring is also a rewarding way to give back to the community
        and help the next generation succeed. Mentoring can also open new doors for one's own career opportunities and
        strengthen one's own expertise.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Mentoring is therefore a win-win situation where both parties benefit!

    <h2>How does the program work in practice?</h2>
    <p>
      In the approximately six-month mentoring program, the mentor and actor meet at least three times at agreed-upon
      times. The actual number and frequency of meetings can be freely agreed upon by the mentor and actor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Participants should prepare for meetings in advance according to the agreed-upon topic. The themes and discussion
      topics of the meetings can be freely agreed upon according to the actor's wishes. TiTTu's project team provides
      materials and resources to help in planning the process and outlining topics. During the mentoring, the actor and
      mentor jointly create goals and operating methods that they commit to for the duration of the program.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main thing is that the mentoring is meaningful and beneficial for both parties!

    <h2>What is expected of the mentor?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>A desire to share experiences and perspectives to support the student</li>
      <li>Genuine interest in helping the student in their career</li>
      <li>Commitment to the program</li>
      <li>Interest in learning</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The mentor's work experience, professional background, or position does not matter, as we want as diverse and
      varied a group of people as possible to be mentors. We offer support materials and resources on mentoring to help
      you get started. The most important thing is that the mentor is ready and willing to help and support the
      achievement of the set goals. No prior mentoring experience is required. We are not looking for professional-level
      career coaches, but just ordinary TiTe alumni (or those with an alumni spirit) to help other, ordinary TiTe
      members. To ensure that the mentoring experience is pleasant and rewarding for both, we hope that the mentor will
      commit to supporting the actor in the agreed-upon ways for six months.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>What is expected of the actor, i.e., the mentee?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>An understanding of which topics they want support from the mentor on</li>
      <li>Commitment to the program</li>
      <li>A desire to learn new things and gain new perspectives</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The actor's background does not matter. You can be an early-stage student, soon graduating, or already in working
      life. We are looking for actors who have at least a rough idea of the topics they want support with. Specific
      topics and goals may already be in mind, but they can also be formed or further developed with the mentor. The
      topics of mentoring can include, for example, study planning, job searching, improving CVs and cover letters,
      long-term career planning, or even writing a Master's thesis.
    </p>
    <p>
      The purpose of mentoring is not to provide ready-made solutions, but to guide the actor forward. The actor must be
      open to different perspectives and genuinely interested in solving the challenges they face. To ensure that the
      mentoring experience is pleasant and rewarding for both, we expect the actor to commit to meetings with the mentor
      as well as to their own learning process. The actor is required to commit to meetings and prepare for them, and
      the actor must also be open to discussion and feedback.
